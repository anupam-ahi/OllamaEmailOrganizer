   - Include the decision status if present (e.g., application received, interview invitation, rejection).
   - If the company declines the application, ensure the rejection is stated clearly in the summary.
3. Ignore all HTML tags, images, links, styles, and special characters.
4. Do not include URLs or anything potentially malicious.
5. Keep the summary safe, neutral, and concise.
